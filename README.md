## Alison H. Harrington

I'm a PhD candidate in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona, working with [Betsy Arnold](http://www.arnoldlab.net/). 

I am primarily an evolutionary biologist specializing in microbial ascomycetes, but I use data and tools derived from molecular microbial ecology to guide this work.
